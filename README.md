Documenting my 100 days of code


### Day 1: April 25, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: One of my favourite front-end resources is Frontend Mentor. They have a brilliant selection of designs to work from and today I started with Base Apparel. It really give me a chance to brush up on my Flexbox knowledge and put it into practice. 

The majority of my HTML/CSS knowledge comes from creating newsletters (what a breath of fresh air it was to use something like Flexbox as opposed to tables) and I really enjoy bringing designs to life with code. 

**Thoughts:** My JavaScript knowledge it pretty limited, I know some concepts like variables, methods, functions, but I haven't encountered any real world scenarios to put them into practice,  so for the form validation I coded along with a tutorial on YouTube as I find I learn better by 'doing'.

### Day 2: April 26, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I made some further updates to the Base Apparel landing page to make it responsive. 

**Thoughts**: It's been really satisfying to get to grips with elements I'm less familiar with (coming from an email template background) such as position and flexbox. While I can see how the JavaScript is working it's magic, I still couldn't write that particular script from scratch - I need to keep in mind that it's a brand new language and to stick with it.

### Day 3: April 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've been doing a lot of CSS quiz's on the fly to test my knowledge. I think overall it's really good, but I defintely know where the gaps in my knowledge lie.

**Thoughts** I need to research more JavaScipt resources with practical exercises. 

### Day 4: April 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started a new landing page from Frontend Mentor. It's another 2 column example but I really wanted to use Flexbox again and try some multi-input validation JS. 

**Thoughts** I haven't added any JS yet. I figured I would try the Wes Bos JavaScript30 challenge and then revisit. But the landing page looks good on desktop and mobile.

### Day 5: April 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I started the Wes Bos JavaScript30 challenge, which I loved. He really breaks it all down to make it less daunting. I even managed to code ahead for a bit of it and didn't break anything! Obviously I redesigned it all because I love CSS. I used Grid for the first time!

**Thoughts** It feels really good to stick with these projects and finish them. Too often I've been guilty of jumping from tutorial to tutorial and getting zero out of it apart from confusing myself! Excited for the next project.

### Day 6: April 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today's project was a JavaScript clock. Again, I coded along and then added my own CSS. I could feel myself getting carried away and wanting to transform the background into a 70's wall, complete with 3 flying ornamental ducks, jazzy wallpaper and a crazy clockface. But alas, I held back and kept it relatively clean and simple! The tutorials are definitely starting to make an impact. I'm anticipating the next lines of code and (mostly) getting it right!

I also discovered the debugging term 'Rubber Ducking' which is a fun bit of trivia I will definitely be putting into practice in the near future.

**Thoughts** I find when I'm really in this zone of learning and enjoying creating, I have to fight the urge to start multiple new projects. It mostly happens when I see amazing work by other developers. For example I saw on Twitter today someone had created a Macbook keyboard using CSS...immediately wanted to create my own. FOCUS!! My main goal for this challenge is to learn JavaScript. Plenty of time for CSS later.

### Day 7: May 01, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today's tutorial looked at using JS to target CSS variables and change the filter, spacing and background-colour of an image. It was really interesting but I think I'm having a bit of an 'off day'. Watched the tutorial twice (coded along the second time) and then did a few lessons in Codecademy.

**Thoughts**: I need to bookmark a good JS reference site for getting familiar with all the different terminology. I was off my game a bit today but I know it will pass. Tomorrow is a new day!

### Day 8: May 02, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today was Array Cardio day! Quite a number of exercises to get to grips with. Afterwards I started the Wes Bos Javascript for Beginners course. I find if I'm doing an hour or so of lessons and then putting it into practise it sinks in a lot faster. I know this method isn't for everyone (going from beginner level lessons to then looking at more advanced exercises) but it helps me join the dots and understand the potential of what I'm learning. 

**Thoughts**: If I'm honest, I thought that learning JavaScript would be really dull, but the more I use it the more I love it. Again, trying not to get ahead of myself and start building multiple projects. Living vicariously through what other people are creating during the 100DaysOfCode challenge and thinking about what I would like to build once I'm more confident with the language.

### Day 9: May 03, 2020

**Today's Progress**: In today's lesson we created a Flex panel gallery. This particular project used hardly any JS, all the animation/transformation came from CSS. 

**Thoughts**:  As I'm learning I'm trying to apply it to previous projects and how the designs could benefit from this new knowledge. I also might go back and redesign my JS Drum Kit. Maybe base it on something real to see how close I can get it. I know my journey is going to be mostly learning JavaScript but I can have a little CSS, as a treat?

Edit: I updated the drum kit to make it look more like an electronic drumkit.
