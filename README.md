# 100daysofcode

Documenting my 100 days of code

### Day 1: April 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: One of my favourite front-end resources is Frontend Mentor. They have a brilliant selection of designs to work from and today I started with Base Apparel. It really give me a chance to brush up on my Flexbox knowledge and put it into practice.

The majority of my HTML/CSS knowledge comes from creating newsletters (what a breath of fresh air it was to use something like Flexbox as opposed to tables) and I really enjoy bringing designs to life with code.

**Thoughts:** My JavaScript knowledge it pretty limited, I know some concepts like variables, methods, functions, but I haven't encountered any real world scenarios to put them into practice, so for the form validation I coded along with a tutorial on YouTube as I find I learn better by 'doing'.

### Day 2: April 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I made some further updates to the Base Apparel landing page to make it responsive.

**Thoughts**: It's been really satisfying to get to grips with elements I'm less familiar with (coming from an email template background) such as position and flexbox. While I can see how the JavaScript is working it's magic, I still couldn't write that particular script from scratch - I need to keep in mind that it's a brand new language and to stick with it.

### Day 3: April 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've been doing a lot of CSS quiz's on the fly to test my knowledge. I think overall it's really good, but I defintely know where the gaps in my knowledge lie.

**Thoughts** I need to research more JavaScipt resources with practical exercises.

### Day 4: April 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started a new landing page from Frontend Mentor. It's another 2 column example but I really wanted to use Flexbox again and try some multi-input validation JS.

**Thoughts** I haven't added any JS yet. I figured I would try the Wes Bos JavaScript30 challenge and then revisit. But the landing page looks good on desktop and mobile.

### Day 5: April 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I started the Wes Bos JavaScript30 challenge, which I loved. He really breaks it all down to make it less daunting. I even managed to code ahead for a bit of it and didn't break anything! Obviously I redesigned it all because I love CSS. I used Grid for the first time!

**Thoughts** It feels really good to stick with these projects and finish them. Too often I've been guilty of jumping from tutorial to tutorial and getting zero out of it apart from confusing myself! Excited for the next project.

### Day 6: April 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today's project was a JavaScript clock. Again, I coded along and then added my own CSS. I could feel myself getting carried away and wanting to transform the background into a 70's wall, complete with 3 flying ornamental ducks, jazzy wallpaper and a crazy clockface. But alas, I held back and kept it relatively clean and simple! The tutorials are definitely starting to make an impact. I'm anticipating the next lines of code and (mostly) getting it right!

I also discovered the debugging term 'Rubber Ducking' which is a fun bit of trivia I will definitely be putting into practice in the near future.

**Thoughts** I find when I'm really in this zone of learning and enjoying creating, I have to fight the urge to start multiple new projects. It mostly happens when I see amazing work by other developers. For example I saw on Twitter today someone had created a Macbook keyboard using CSS...immediately wanted to create my own. FOCUS!! My main goal for this challenge is to learn JavaScript. Plenty of time for CSS later.

**Link(s) to work**: [JavaScript Clock](https://github.com/elshaw82/JavaScript30/tree/master/02%20-%20JS%20and%20CSS%20Clock)

### Day 7: May 01, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today's tutorial looked at using JS to target CSS variables and change the filter, spacing and background-colour of an image. It was really interesting but I think I'm having a bit of an 'off day'. Watched the tutorial twice (coded along the second time) and then did a few lessons in Codecademy.

**Thoughts**: I need to bookmark a good JS reference site for getting familiar with all the different terminology. I was off my game a bit today but I know it will pass. Tomorrow is a new day!

**Link(s) to work**: [CSS Variables](https://github.com/elshaw82/JavaScript30/tree/master/03%20-%20CSS%20Variables)

### Day 8: May 02, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today was Array Cardio day! Quite a number of exercises to get to grips with. Afterwards I started the Wes Bos Javascript for Beginners course. I find if I'm doing an hour or so of lessons and then putting it into practise it sinks in a lot faster. I know this method isn't for everyone (going from beginner level lessons to then looking at more advanced exercises) but it helps me join the dots and understand the potential of what I'm learning.

**Thoughts**: If I'm honest, I thought that learning JavaScript would be really dull, but the more I use it the more I love it. Again, trying not to get ahead of myself and start building multiple projects. Living vicariously through what other people are creating during the 100DaysOfCode challenge and thinking about what I would like to build once I'm more confident with the language.

**Link(s) to work**: [Array Cardio](https://github.com/elshaw82/JavaScript30/blob/master/04%20-%20Array%20Cardio%20Day%201/index.html)

### Day 9: May 03, 2020

**Today's Progress**: In today's lesson we created a Flex panel gallery. This particular project used hardly any JS, all the animation/transformation came from CSS.

**Thoughts**: As I'm learning I'm trying to apply it to previous projects and how the designs could benefit from this new knowledge. I also might go back and redesign my JS Drum Kit. Maybe base it on something real to see how close I can get it. I know my journey is going to be mostly learning JavaScript but I can have a little CSS, as a treat?

Edit: I updated the drum kit to make it look more like an electronic drumkit.

### Day 10: May 04, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I mostly did a few a function exercises today and then messed around in Visual Studio to test what I had learned. Today's JavaScript30 exercise was a Type Ahead function in a search bar to locate different cities and states.

**Thoughts**: Driling into the absolute basics is really helping. I know my confidence will grow once I truly understand the fundamentals of this language. I've yet to have my Eureka! moment where it all totally makes sense, but I'm definitely seeing an improvement each day.

**Link(s) to work**: [Type Ahead Search](https://github.com/elshaw82/JavaScript30/tree/master/06%20-%20Type%20Ahead)

### Day 11: May 05, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Yet more function practice today! Learning all the different types and when to use them. I understand how they work, it's trying to remember everything that goes along with each type. I think when I get to The Dom - HTML/CSS elements section of this course I'll be able to practice in a way that helps better my understanding.

**Thoughts**: Treated myself to some CSS styling. I know! But my head was fried after an hour or so of function chat. Paused my JavaScript30 work to get my head around all the function work.

**Link(s) to work**: [Responsive Sign Up Form](https://github.com/elshaw82/single-price-grid-component-master)

### Day 12: May 06, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I looked at debugging tools, scope, hoisting and closures. It's a lot to take in but I'm hoping when I start the DOM module next it will all start falling into place.

**Thoughts**: Feeling positive about what I'm learning and excited about how much it will open up what I'm able to create in the future.

**Link(s) to work**: No work to link to today - just a full on study day!

### Day 13: May 07, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started the DOM module today. Looked at selecting elements, element properties and methods, working with classes, built in and custom data attributes and finally creating HTML with JavaScript. It's pretty full on!

Found a nice Spotify landing page on Dribbble to code to get my CSS fix.

**Thoughts**: Looking forward to more practical exercises where we are working towards building something. I've been looking at past JavaScript I've worked with/coded along with and it's all making much more sense to me. I'm moving in the right direction!

**Link(s) to work**: No work to link to today - mostly practicing and coding along!

### Day 14: May 08, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Looked at creating HTML from strings, XSS, traversing and removing nodes then some DOM cardio! Enjoyed trying out what I've learned so far. Did some work on the Dribbble Spotify page.

**Thoughts**: It's a lot to take in but I'm enjoying the DOM module and getting some real world scenario practice in.

**Link(s) to work**: [Dribbble Spotify landing page](https://github.com/elshaw82/dribbble)

### Day 15: May 09, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I looked at events and event listeners. This concept made total sense right away as I've used Tag Manager a lot in the past for work.

**Thoughts**: Intimidated slightly by the various ways of creating functions/events but it's just a matter of practice! There are some practical challanges coming up soon, which I'm excited to get stuck into!

**Link(s) to work**: No work, just lessons today.

### Day 16: May 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Had a break from JavaScript today and instead put together some plans for a portfolio website. I'm nearly happy with it! Need to work on a mobile navigation menu and adding in the content.

**Thoughts**: It was nice to put some more CSS grid into practice. Back to JavaScript tomorrow!

**Link(s) to work**: [Portfolio Website in progress](https://github.com/elshaw82/Elaine-Shaw)

### Day 17: May 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I started a module of practical exercises. First up, a JavaScript etch-a-sketch! This was fun and it covered a few aspects that we haven't touched upon yet.

**Thoughts**: Feeling more and more positive about my progress and what I'll be able to create at the end of this!

**Link(s) to work**: [JS Etch-a-sketch](https://github.com/elshaw82/beginner-javascript/tree/master/exercises/33%20-%20Etch-a-Sketch)

### Day 18: May 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Read about Neumorphism and decided to and recreate a design I saw here (https://uxplanet.org/neumorphism-in-user-interface-tutorial-c353698ac5c0). I didn't follow the tutorial, but I ended up going back and using the box shadows as my colours weren't quite right.

**Thoughts**: This was an interesting challenge. I understand the limitations of these designs with regards to accessability but this was more of an exercise in box-shadows!

**Link(s) to work**: [Neumorphism/Soft UI interface creation](https://github.com/elshaw82/Neumorphism) [CodePen ](https://codepen.io/elshaw82/full/YzyjPJL)

### Day 19: May 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I did a couple of JavaScript quizes and half a lesson of combining CSS animation and JavaScript to open up an modal window when a button is clicked. I also went back to yesterday's interface work and added some media queries.

**Thoughts**: Having an off day today! Back to it tomorrow. I'm happy I managed to a do a little bit of coding at least!

**Link(s) to work**: Studying, some practice exercises and quizzes today.

### Day 20: May 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked through another exercise today - click outside modal. I was following along but got a bit lost! So I decided to go back to some work from the other day and add some missing media queries, followed by some JavaScript quizzes.

**Thoughts**: I knew it wouldn't help to sit and get frustrated with the project, better to look at it with fresh eyes tomorrow!

**Link(s) to work**: CSS, some practice exercises and quizzes today.

### Day 21: May 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I went back to yesterday's exercise and fixed the issue within 2 minutes! (I hadn't defined a variable.) Sometimes it's good to come back to work with fresh eyes!

**Thoughts**: It feels good to overcome an obstacle (even a really obvious one!)

**Link(s) to work**: Completed the exercise.

### Day 22: May 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a tab exercise today using JavaScript, then did some practice on my own. Made a start on a Frontend Mentor landing page and also did a fun Flexbox quiz!

**Thoughts**: Struggled a bit to focus today, but tomorrow will be better!

**Link(s) to work**:

### Day 23: May 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked through some grid quizzes and revisted past JS modules.

**Thoughts**:

**Link(s) to work**:

### Day 24: May 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Back to JavaScript today! Looked at BEDMAS, Flow control - if statements, function returns, truthy, falsy.

**Thoughts**: Felt a bit frustrated today! But I worked through the code and sorted out where I was going wrong (it was a missing parentheses) I'll probably go over today's lesson again tomorrow to make it stick!

**Link(s) to work**:

### Day 25: May 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Went over Flow control - if statements, function returns, truthy, falsy again. Felt myself losing focus, so I created another soft UI design.

**Thoughts**: Really pleased with the interface I created. I was hoping to do a JavaScript calculator in this style, but it was way more complicated than I expected. Another time!

### Day 26: May 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made a start on a FreeCodeCamp Tetris code-along exercise. Pretty fast-paced but I'm enjoying the challenge! Definitely feels like good progress.

**Thoughts**:

**Link(s) to work**:

### Day 27: May 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Full JavaScript day today! Currently learning about Coercion, Ternaries and Conditional Abuse. I finished my Tetris tutorial but it didn't really work - tried debugging to no avail. I then copied the code from the lesson and it was throwing the same error so who knows! Quite frustrating, but it was an interesting project (when it was working).

**Thoughts**: I found the FCC Tetris tutorial quite tricky, even though it was labelled as beginner level. It's hard not to feel a bit disheartened when something is labelled as 'beginner/easy' and even with a decent bit of knowledge, you still struggle! Oh well. I managed to use a lot of what I was learning in my course in new ways, so that's something! Hopefully at the end of this I'll be able to revisit it and fix the problem.

**Link(s) to work**: [Tetris - not quite working](https://github.com/elshaw82/Tetris)

### Day 28: May 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: No JavaScript today. Instead, I gave Empire Records a website! This was really fun and gave me the opportunity to play around with layouts and animation. I'd like to keep working on it to give more pages, make it responsive and make it more interactive.

**Thoughts**: It's really nice to give yourself a break when your feeling a bit defeated and work on something different. Back at it tomorrow!

**Link(s) to work**: [Empire Records](https://github.com/elshaw82/Empire-Records)

### Day 29: May 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I created a random quote generator in less than an hour - this was extremely rewarding as it was the first thing I ever tried to make using JS a couple of months ago and I just couldn't quite get it right. It's important to celebrate these little milestones as a reminder of just how far you have come!

**Thoughts**: Looking at what mini projects I can start using JavaScript next!

### Day 30: May 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got to grips with keyframe animations today! I had no idea just how much you could do with them. A lot of fun and endless possibilities. I made a dripping icecream cone.

**Thoughts**: The first time I looked into keyframes I was a bit overwhelmed, but having spent a few hours playing around I feel way more confident in what I can create now. Really exciting!

**Link(s) to work**: [Ice-Cream Cone](https://codepen.io/elshaw82/full/LYpvYPG)

### Day 31: May 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Fixed a few glitches in yesterday's animation and added a few more details. Planning to make a start on a JavaScript Rock, Paper, Scissors game today.

**Thoughts**: Feeling positive about my progress and the possibilities each new skill unlocks!

**Link(s) to work**: [Ice-Cream Cone](https://github.com/elshaw82/Ice-Cream-Cone)

### Day 32: May 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked through a tutorial for creating a JavaScript Rock, Paper, Scissors game! Really enjoyed this one and felt I had some real lightbulb moments with the process!

**Thoughts**: Looking for another beginner level game to code!

**Link(s) to work**: [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://elshaw82.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)

### Day 33: May 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I decided to give CSS Grid my full attention today and create a website for a fictional coffee company. CSS Flex and Grid really baffled me at the beginning of my 100 Days of Code journey - When do you use one over the other? What's the difference, but it's super clear in my mind now!

**Thoughts**: I'd quite like to create some more complex grid layouts and incorporate some nice interactive burger menus for mobile.

**Link(s) to work**: [Coffee Company Website](https://elshaw82.github.io/css-grid-website/)

### Day 34: May 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a radio with a blinking display screen using CSS. This was based on the one I have in my kitchen! Definitely prefer recreating real world examples and objects. Next up on my JavaScript course: Loops and arrays.

**Thoughts**: Might revisit Wes Bos JavaScript 30 to see how much has sunk in!

**Link(s) to work**: [CSS Radio](https://codepen.io/elshaw82/full/ExVBvQg)

### Day 35: May 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a lightswitch which toggles a light and dark background. Pretty simple JavaScript, but I'm happy I managed to do it myself! I couldn't get the switch styles to toggle but I think I might need if statements for that. Did some more Array Cardio from JavaScript30.

**Thoughts**: I think tomorrow I'm going to look into before and after pseudo classes.

**Link(s) to work**: [Lightswitch](https://codepen.io/elshaw82/full/QWjeEvM)

### Day 36: May 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made a start on another Frontend Mentor challenge. This one was a landing page for a bank and allowed me to utilise css grid again. Going to watch some tutorials on pseudo classes (before and after)

**Thoughts**: Back to JavaScript tomorrow.

**Link(s) to work**: Incomplete currently, but the files are up.

### Day 37: May 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More JavaScript today, mostly Array work. Went over some previous lessons and did a few coding quizes to solidify the lessons!

**Thoughts**:

**Link(s) to work**:

### Day 38: June 01, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I didn't do any coding today in light of everything that is happening in the world. I was glued to twitter most of the day. Did some reflecting and listening instead.

**Thoughts**:

**Link(s) to work**:

### Day 39: June 02, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Looked into maps in JavaScript today and more Array work.

**Thoughts**: Motivation is low today. I know it will pass so I'm trying not to beat myself up over not uploading.

\*_Link(s) to work_

### Day 40: June 03, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a soft UI calculator, followed by some more Array work - static methods, instance methods, callback methods and function generation. Whew! Starting the loop module tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: The JS for the calculator was a tutorial. Most of it I understood, but I have much more work to do before I can create my own work from scratch I think.

\*_Link(s) to work_ [Soft UI Calculator](https://codepen.io/elshaw82/full/GRoRBXK)

### Day 41: June 04, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I revisited my dark-mode/light-mode switch and made the class toggle work. It was really simple and didn't involve if statements like I originally suggested. That feeling when you get something to work is so rewarding! More array work today. I'll start the loop module tomorrow instead I think. I enjoy the array practice and there is a lot to cover!

**Thoughts**: So pleased about the lightswitch toggle. Ha! I wish I had designed a cooler lightswitch now.

\*_Link(s) to work_ [Lightswitch - updated](https://codepen.io/elshaw82/full/QWjeEvM)

### Day 42: June 05, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started on the loop module today - forEach, Mapping, filter, find and higher order functions. It's a lot! But a few of the tutorials I've already worked on have covered these a little, so that definitely helped. I made a simple canvas drawing and a wack-a-mole game from JavaScript 30.

**Thoughts**: I need to start building more without tutorials and get a few of the terms and methods straight in my head.

\*_Link(s) to work_

### Day 43: June 06, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finally got round to looking at pseudo elements - before and after, followed by some JS quizzes!

**Thoughts**: Back to loops tomorrow!

\*_Link(s) to work_

### Day 44: June 07, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did some loop exercises today - reduce, filter and find. I've used some of these already in tutorials so it all makes sense. Looking forward to doing some more practical work with these.

**Thoughts**: I always feel bad when I dont have a project to link to, but I find the days of studying and exercises really useful too!

\*_Link(s) to work_

### Day 45: June 08, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Getting loopy! Finished the loop module today, covering for, for in, for of and while loops. They make sense, but I feel like I would have a more solid understanding if I were using them in a real world scenario. Module 10 covers more difficult practice exercises, so I'm sure I'll get to see them in action.

**Thoughts**: Again, no work to link to as most of today involved practice exercises and a lot of tutorials. The next module should produce some links :)

\*_Link(s) to work_

## Day 46: June 09, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I created a connect 4 game (via Ania Kubów) It was a nice break from all the loop lessons and it also feels really rewarding when you start building along with someone and the code makes sense and features a lot of the aspects you've been learning.

Edit - I had some free time this evening, so I recreated the Spotify mobile player!

**Thoughts**: Trying to put together a list of smaller projects to create over the next 50 days to break up the JavaScript lessons.

## Day 47: June 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did a few JavaScript exercises on FreeCodeCamp today. The next module of my course is an hour long Face Detection/Censorship exercise, so I need a bit of time to work on it!

**Thoughts**: I'm having good days and bad days in terms of motivation, but I guess that's normal. The good days are really good and I'm usually really happy with what I produce and I always learn something new.

\*_Link(s) to work_

## Day 48: June 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More JavaScript today. Jumped back on JavaScript 30 and sorted an array into a list without articles using join, map, for each and some reg ex.

**Thoughts**: A really quick exercise but I find the elements used stick a lot more in the smaller exercises.

\*_Link(s) to work_

## Day 49: June 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Another JavaScript 30 challenge today in the form of an on scroll sticky nav. Always wondered how this was achieved!

**Thoughts**: Starting to think about putting together a portfolio website, without getting too far ahead of myself! Thinking about a nice grid layout, a stick nav, and some nice animation.

\*_Link(s) to work_

## Day 50: June 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Full on JavaScript day today. Revisited some earlier modules from the course and played around with some code to make a push button confetti drop. Not quite there yet, but it's the first day in a while that I've been able to just mess around with code and make mistakes!

**Thoughts**: Had a look at some codepens for inspiration - it really does motivate you to keep going!

\*_Link(s) to work_

## Day 51: June 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: To celebrate reaching the halfway point of my journey, I've created a little "push for confetti" animation. Took me a bit of time to figure out that I needed to loop over each div to add the new class. Google is my friend!

**Thoughts**: I feel like celebrating having thought of an idea using JavaScript and seeing it throught to completion!

\*_Link(s) to work_

## Day 52: June 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a custom HTML 5 video player. If I had done this particular project a few days ago it would have saved me a bit of heartache when trying to create the confetti project! I'm getting so much faster at coding along and I anticipating what to do next.

**Thoughts**: Listened to a Code Newbie podcast today which talked about the importance of learning Vanilla JavaScript before looking into any frameworks. Really happy I chose to learn the fundamentals first!

\*_Link(s) to work_

## Day 53: June 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Had a bit of a hectic day today so I didn't start coding until a bit later than usual. Made a good start on a CSS & HTML lava lamp. Planning to add a bit of JavaScript to toggle an on/off switch.

**Thoughts**: Really enjoyed playing around with keyframes and using percentages to change the border and overall shape of the "lava".

\*_Link(s) to work_

## Day 54: June 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished my lava lamp today! This was so fun and infuriating! I think the code could definitely be simplified but it was good practice.

**Thoughts**: I'd like to fix the code at some point so that you can restart the animation after you've switched it off.

\*_Link(s) to work_ [Lava Lamp](https://codepen.io/elshaw82/full/MWKbvpZ)

## Day 55: June 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I created a crystal ball that animates on click and displays an answer. Really pleased with it! Definitely feeling more confident with JavaScript these days.

**Thoughts**:

## Day 56: June 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Followed an Ania Kubow memory game tutorial today and also did a bit of beginners SVG.

**Thoughts**: I never thought I would say this, but I'm starting to enjoy JavaScript more than CSS!

\*_Link(s) to work_ [Clueles Memory Game](https://codepen.io/elshaw82/full/bGEqpXy)

## Day 57: June 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did some more reading up on SVG creation. I've seen some really cool animations using SVGs, so I figured it would be a great bonus skill to have.

**Thoughts**: Might create another grid website tomorrow.

\*_Link(s) to work_ Nope! Just practice!

## Day 58: June 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished my NASA API project today. Not 100% happy with the layout, but it works and a lot of the JavaScript I worked out myself which has been incredibly rewarding.

**Thoughts**: This was my first look at API's and it's not at all as daunting as it sounds. Really interested in what other things I could build for my portfolio.

\*_Link(s) to work_ Nope! Just practice!

## Day 59: June 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished my NASA API project today. Not 100% happy with the layout, but it works and a lot of the JavaScript I worked out myself which has been incredibly rewarding.

**Thoughts**: I think if I could have peeked at what I would be creating by the half-way point way back at the start of my 100 days of code journey, I would be shocked! I'm really enjoying JavaScript now that I've broken through those first few lessons and frustrations.

## Day 60: June 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Playing around with mobile navigation today (hamburger menu). I've seen a lot of cool transformations and animations recently so it's on my list of things to try out.

**Thoughts**: I ran out of time today. Managed to make a start on things but not finished.

## Day 61: June 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: What started out as me experimenting with mobile navigation, has turned into me starting my own portfolio website! It feels good to take my time with each part and get it right. Before I would really focus on the aesthetics and not pay enough attention to what was going on under the hood, but I think I'm definitely becoming more invested in the little details, which is more to do with growing confidence in the technology I'm using!

**Thoughts**: Feeling really proud of how far I've come in the last 61 days. Excited to look back at 100 and see everything I've made...maybe do round 2!

## Day 64: June 27 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I created an animated toaster using a combination of CSS and JavaScript. First time using interval timings to control the animation. It turned out great!

**Thoughts**: Keep thinking about a quote from Wes Bos: "Being able to make your ideas is a super power." It really is!

## Day 65: June 28 2020

**Today's Progress**: I created a countdown to Primavera Sound 2021. It was a little more complicated than I expected but I got there in the end and it was the perfect project to use the modulus operator.

**Thoughts**: Fun to make something that I can actually use.

## Day 66: June 29 2020

**Today's Progress**: I was all geared up to make a cocktail finder using another API, but once I had set up the page I started getting frustrated with the design and then confused myself trying to set up the API. I know in a couple of days when I come back to it I'll see the problem immediately.

Instead I created a little toggle slider button. Trying not to be disheartened about hitting a bit of a JavaScript wall today...it's been a while.

**Thoughts**: Back to it tomorrow.

## Day 67: June 30 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished what couldn't yesterday! Funnily enough, the solution to the problem I was having yesterday came to me as I was drifting off to sleep last night! Ha! Really pleased with how it turned out. I made it responsive too.

**Thoughts**: Need to do more CSS Grid work. It still intimidates me!

## Day 68: July 01 2020

**Today's Progress**: CSS Grid all day today courtesy of Wes Bos. It was definitely needed. Feeling a bit more confident, but I still need to refer to past work and CSS Tricks. I've added a small portfolio grid section to what will be my portfolio. It's not finalised but it's a good basis!

**Thoughts**: Back to JavaScript tomorrow.

\*_Link(s) to work_ I did a lot of image gallery work, but it was a bit of pain to upload so many images so no link today.

## Day 69: July 02 2020

**Today's Progress**: I created a simple HTML5 canvas project today. Really interesting working on this having done a little bit with canvas at the beginning when my JavaScript knowledge was minimal!

**Thoughts**: Definitely hope to do more tutorials on this as there is so much potential!

## Day 70: July 03 2020

**Today's Progress**: A simple responsive contact form today based on a nice design from Dribbble.

**Thoughts**: I had big ideas for today, but I just ran out of time and then this actually took a little bit longer than I thought it would.

## Day 71: July 04 2020

**Today's Progress**: A bit of everthing today: grid, flex and JavaScript to create some Pantone style cards. The background changes to the corresponding colour when you click the card.

**Thoughts**: I think the JS could be simplified but I totally overthought it!

## Day 72: July 05 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did a lot of Grid work today. Mostly blog layouts. Then a bit of 'this' and 'new' in JavaScript.

**Thoughts**: Determined to get more confident with grid!

## Day 73: July 06 2020

**Today's Progress**: Had a bit of a soul destroying day today. Started a mini course on the command line and....yikes. Much frustration. Decided to do a JS project and couldn't achieve what I wanted. Double frustration.

**Thoughts**: Trying not to be too disheartened by my lack of progress today.

\*_Link(s) to work_

## Day 74: July 07 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created an events page based on a Dribbble design today using grid. It looked ok but the code was a mess to be honest. I need to start sketching things out beforehand to make it more logical and modular. I'm also trying to ensure I use as much accessible code as possible and not have div soup in my work!

**Thoughts**: Things to work on: More JavaScript, Grid, Best Practices for structuring my code, Command Line (urgh). I was feeling really rubbish about it all today, but a stranger actually reached out with some words of encouragement which was so nice and just what I needed. Trying not to be too hard on myself.

\*_Link(s) to work_ Code was a mess and not responsive, so no links.

## Day 75: July 08 2020

**Today's Progress**: So today I didn't start coding until much later in the day. After feeling so frustrated and dishearted over the previous two days I didn't really know what I could work on and finish with what little time I had left. So, I opened up my failed project from monday and I did it! In less than an hour!! What a buzz to have your project brought to life and work! I'm so happy I gave it another shot.

**Thoughts**: This has been a nice motivator!

## Day 76: July 09 2020

**Today's Progress**: A frustrating day today! I had very little time to create, so I'm just going to use the last 30mins of my day to go over some earlier lessons from my JavaScript course.

**Thoughts**: I may not have a link to post today, but I am still using what time I have to learn.

\*_Link(s) to work_

## Day 77: July 10 2020

**Today's Progress**: A simple responsive nav today. I had to scale it way back as I had orginally started creating a product landing page but I'm not a designer, so I found it hard with nothing to work from.

**Thoughts**: Struggling with focussing on a project to create each day this week. Need to get back to JavaScript tomorrow.

## Day 79: July 12 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a CSS paint set today then did a little more JavaScript lessons (going back and revisiting earlier modules on looping)

**Thoughts**:

\*_Link(s) to work_ No link - not 100% happy with my creation!

## Day 80: July 13 2020

**Today's Progress**: Went over some looping modules again and then a started a few lessons on prototypes.

**Thoughts**: Might do a code along of a game tomorrow.

\*_Link(s) to work_

## Day 81: July 14 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a mobile article preview component from Frontend Mentor with a little JavaScript show/hide function.

**Thoughts**: I feel a bit uninspired this week! I want to create games, canvas animations, keep learning JavaScript, practice grid...start learning React! It's hard to fit it all in or know where to start when you're feeling a bit bleurgh. Tomorrow is a new day.

## Day 82: July 15 2020

**Today's Progress**: Watched a tutorial on how to animate SVGs and it looks way less complicated than I thought it would be. Now I just need to decide what software to download to create my own...

**Thoughts**: Back to JS tomorrow.

\*_Link(s) to work_

## Day 83: July 16 2020

**Today's Progress**: Made a start on a JS weather app today. Typically though, the api I was using (as recommended by the tutorial) no longer works, so I had to work out a lot of it myself, which was actually pretty nice/reassuring that I do know what I'm doing!

**Thoughts**: Might not get a chance to code tomorrow, but Ill continue this on Saturday.

## Day 85: July 18 2020

**Today's Progress**: A little work on the weather app today. Need to style up the layout and fix the icons.

**Thoughts**: The built in icons are a bit ugly. Might look into Skycons instead.

## Day 86: July 19 2020

**Today's Progress**: Played around with Figma and made some svg graphics. I need to get my tablet out and make them look a bit sharper. Then I can work on animating them. I have a few ideas, just need to sort the graphics out first.

**Thoughts**: I've been so busy over the last days with lockdown easing, sorting out some personal stuff. Hoping to have more time this week!

\*_Link(s) to work_

## Day 87: July 20 2020

**Today's Progress**: Watched a tonne of tutorials on how to animate SVGs. I need to change my set up to fit another monitor as it's too fiddly doing it on a single screen!

**Thoughts**: Got some ideas on what to work on tomorrow.

\*_Link(s) to work_

# Day 88: July 21 2020

**Today's Progress**: An SVG animation today. Keeping it simple in order to learn the basics!

**Thoughts**: Back to pure JS practice tomorrow.

# Day 89: July 22 2020

**Today's Progress**: Another SVG animation today using anime.js! Morphing a sun into a moon with added dark mode toggle! I also created a personalised ReadMe for my Github profile.

**Thoughts**: Been getting to grips with Figma over the last few days and this was also my first time using a JS library.

# Day 90: July 23 2020

**Today's Progress**: Revisited JavaScript30 and coded along with the Stripe style dynamic dropdown nav tutorial.

**Thoughts**: Really enjoyed this one - may style it up to make my own.

# Day 91: July 24 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've been trying to better my understanding of best practices for accessibility. I purchased Accessibility for Everyone by Laura Kalbag before lockdown but it's in my desk drawer at work annoyingly! Found https://www.a11yproject.com/ to be a really good source of information and resources.

**Thoughts**: I want to be able to create inclusive projects. Not as an afterthought! Deliberate and thoughtful work.

# Day 92: July 25 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did a few JS exercises on FreeCodeCamp today.

**Thoughts**: Interested in learning more about algorithms and data structure.

# Day 93: July 25 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time browsing CodePen, looking for some inspo. Feeling a bit flat in terms of what I should create! I also did a few CSS grid quizzes.

**Thoughts**: I keep finding more and more things to learn which is exciting but also frustrating. I need to be a little more patient with myself.

\*_Link(s) to work_

# Day 94: July 26 2020

**Today's Progress**: Played around with Figma some more. It's a great tool considering it's free!

**Thoughts**: My plan for next week is to get back to JavaScript. I only have a few modules left to complete.

\*_Link(s) to work_

# Day 95: July 27 2020

**Today's Progress**: Simple CSS loading animation today.

**Thoughts**:

# Day 96: July 28 2020

**Today's Progress**: Have an idea for some SVG animation using tornis.js - inspired by work I saw on Codepen by Andy Barefoot.

**Thoughts**: There is a lot going on at home currently which is leaving me with very little time to work on these projects. It's incredibly frustrating but hopefully I'll get a bit more time in the coming weeks - #100DaysOfCode Round 2?

# Day 97: July 29 2020

**Today's Progress**: Followed along with a Layout Clip tutorial using anime.js which was fun. Really quick to do. Incredibly powerful library!

**Thoughts**: keen on developing the idea I had yesterday using Tornis too!

\*_Link(s) to work_ [anime.js](https://codepen.io/elshaw82/pen/PoZrPJx)

# Day 98: July 30 2020

**Today's Progress**: Tried to create an animation on scroll using Tornis but it's not quite right - I adapted someone else's code so I didn't really know what I was doing!

**Thoughts**: I wonder if I could achieve it without the script.

# Day 99: July 31 2020

**Today's Progress**: Created a store layout using CSS grid. It started off as just a responsive card layout but I went a bit nuts and kept going!

**Thoughts**: I can't believe I'm nearly at the end! I still have a few modules of my course left and I'd like to revisit some earlier ones so that will keep me going.

# Day 100: August 01 2020

**Today's Progress**: Day 100! I did it! What a journey it has been. I've learnt so much, but also learnt how much I still need to learn!

I was in turmoil today trying to decide what to make. In the end I went with a simple toggle for confetti switch.

**Thoughts**: Excited to continue this journey and learn React and SASS.
