# 100daysofcode
Documenting my 100 days of code


### Day 1: April 25, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: One of my favourite front-end resources is Frontend Mentor. They have a brilliant selection of designs to work from and today I started with Base Apparel. It really give me a chance to brush up on my Flexbox knowledge and put it into practice. 

The majority of my HTML/CSS knowledge comes from creating newsletters (what a breath of fresh air it was to use something like Flexbox as opposed to tables) and I really enjoy bringing designs to life with code. 

**Thoughts:** My JavaScript knowledge it pretty limited, I know some concepts like variables, methods, functions, but I haven't encountered any real world scenarios to put them into practice,  so for the form validation I coded along with a tutorial on YouTube as I find I learn better by 'doing'.

### Day 2: April 26, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I made some further updates to the Base Apparel landing page to make it responsive. 

**Thoughts**: It's been really satisfying to get to grips with elements I'm less familiar with (coming from an email template background) such as position and flexbox. While I can see how the JavaScript is working it's magic, I still couldn't write that particular script from scratch - I need to keep in mind that it's a brand new language and to stick with it.

### Day 3: April 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've been doing a lot of CSS quiz's on the fly to test my knowledge. I think overall it's really good, but I defintely know where the gaps in my knowledge lie.

**Thoughts** I need to research more JavaScipt resources with practical exercises. 

### Day 4: April 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started a new landing page from Frontend Mentor. It's another 2 column example but I really wanted to use Flexbox again and try some multi-input validation JS. 

**Thoughts** I haven't added any JS yet. I figured I would try the Wes Bos JavaScript30 challenge and then revisit. But the landing page looks good on desktop and mobile.

### Day 5: April 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I started the Wes Bos JavaScript30 challenge, which I loved. He really breaks it all down to make it less daunting. I even managed to code ahead for a bit of it and didn't break anything! Obviously I redesigned it all because I love CSS. I used Grid for the first time!

**Thoughts** It feels really good to stick with these projects and finish them. Too often I've been guilty of jumping from tutorial to tutorial and getting zero out of it apart from confusing myself! Excited for the next project.

### Day 6: April 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today's project was a JavaScript clock. Again, I coded along and then added my own CSS. I could feel myself getting carried away and wanting to transform the background into a 70's wall, complete with 3 flying ornamental ducks, jazzy wallpaper and a crazy clockface. But alas, I held back and kept it relatively clean and simple! The tutorials are definitely starting to make an impact. I'm anticipating the next lines of code and (mostly) getting it right!

I also discovered the debugging term 'Rubber Ducking' which is a fun bit of trivia I will definitely be putting into practice in the near future.

**Thoughts** I find when I'm really in this zone of learning and enjoying creating, I have to fight the urge to start multiple new projects. It mostly happens when I see amazing work by other developers. For example I saw on Twitter today someone had created a Macbook keyboard using CSS...immediately wanted to create my own. FOCUS!! My main goal for this challenge is to learn JavaScript. Plenty of time for CSS later.

### Day 7: May 01, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today's tutorial looked at using JS to target CSS variables and change the filter, spacing and background-colour of an image. It was really interesting but I think I'm having a bit of an 'off day'. Watched the tutorial twice (coded along the second time) and then did a few lessons in Codecademy.

**Thoughts**: I need to bookmark a good JS reference site for getting familiar with all the different terminology. I was off my game a bit today but I know it will pass. Tomorrow is a new day!

### Day 8: May 02, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today was Array Cardio day! Quite a number of exercises to get to grips with. Afterwards I started the Wes Bos Javascript for Beginners course. I find if I'm doing an hour or so of lessons and then putting it into practise it sinks in a lot faster. I know this method isn't for everyone (going from beginner level lessons to then looking at more advanced exercises) but it helps me join the dots and understand the potential of what I'm learning. 

**Thoughts**: If I'm honest, I thought that learning JavaScript would be really dull, but the more I use it the more I love it. Again, trying not to get ahead of myself and start building multiple projects. Living vicariously through what other people are creating during the 100DaysOfCode challenge and thinking about what I would like to build once I'm more confident with the language.

### Day 9: May 03, 2020

**Today's Progress**: In today's lesson we created a Flex panel gallery. This particular project used hardly any JS, all the animation/transformation came from CSS. 

**Thoughts**:  As I'm learning I'm trying to apply it to previous projects and how the designs could benefit from this new knowledge. I also might go back and redesign my JS Drum Kit. Maybe base it on something real to see how close I can get it. I know my journey is going to be mostly learning JavaScript but I can have a little CSS, as a treat?

Edit: I updated the drum kit to make it look more like an electronic drumkit.

### Day 10: May 04, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I mostly did a few a function exercises today and then messed around in Visual Studio to test what I had learned. Today's JavaScript30 exercise was a Type Ahead function in a search bar to locate different cities and states. 

**Thoughts**:  Driling into the absolute basics is really helping. I know my confidence will grow once I truly understand the fundamentals of this language. I've yet to have my Eureka! moment where it all totally makes sense, but I'm definitely seeing an improvement each day.

### Day 11: May 05, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Yet more function practice today! Learning all the different types and when to use them. I understand how they work, it's trying to remember everything that goes along with each type. I think when I get to The Dom - HTML/CSS elements section of this course I'll be able to practice in a way that helps better my understanding. 

**Thoughts**:   Treated myself to some CSS styling. I know! But my head was fried after an hour or so of function chat. Paused my JavaScript30 work to get my head around all the function work.

### Day 12: May 06, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I looked at debugging tools, scope, hoisting and closures. It's a lot to take in but I'm hoping when I start the DOM module next it will all start falling into place. 

**Thoughts**:  Feeling positive about what I'm learning and excited about how much it will open up what I'm able to create in the future. 

**Link(s) to work**: No work to link to today - just a full on study day!

### Day 13: May 07, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started the DOM module today. Looked at selecting elements, element properties and methods, working with classes, built in and custom data attributes and finally creating HTML with JavaScript. It's pretty full on!

Found a nice Spotify landing page on Dribbble to code to get my CSS fix.

**Thoughts**: Looking forward to more practical exercises where we are working towards building something. I've been looking at past JavaScript I've worked with/coded along with and it's all making much more sense to me. I'm moving in the right direction!

**Link(s) to work**: No work to link to today - mostly practicing and coding along!

### Day 14: May 08, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Looked at creating HTML from strings, XSS, traversing and removing nodes then some DOM cardio! Enjoyed trying out what I've learned so far. Did some work on the Dribbble Spotify page. 

**Thoughts**: It's a lot to take in but I'm enjoying the DOM module and getting some real world scenario practice in.

### Day 15: May 09, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I looked at events and event listeners. This concept made total sense right away as I've used Tag Manager a lot in the past for work. 

**Thoughts**:  Intimidated slightly by the various ways of creating functions/events but it's just a matter of practice! There are some practical challanges coming up soon, which I'm excited to get stuck into!

**Link(s) to work**: No work, just lessons today. 


### Day 16: May 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Had a break from JavaScript today and instead put together some plans for a portfolio website. I'm nearly happy with it! Need to work on a mobile navigation menu and adding in the content.

**Thoughts**: It was nice to put some more CSS grid into practice. Back to JavaScript tomorrow!

### Day 17: May 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I started a module of practical exercises. First up, a JavaScript etch-a-sketch! This was fun and it covered a few aspects that we haven't touched upon yet. 

**Thoughts**: Feeling more and more positive about my progress and what I'll be able to create at the end of this!

### Day 18: May 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Read about Neumorphism and decided to and recreate a design I saw here (https://uxplanet.org/neumorphism-in-user-interface-tutorial-c353698ac5c0). I didn't follow the tutorial, but I ended up going back and using the box shadows as my colours weren't quite right. 

**Thoughts**: This was an interesting challenge. I understand the limitations of these designs with regards to accessability but this was more of an exercise in box-shadows!

### Day 19: May 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I did a couple of JavaScript quizes and half a lesson of combining CSS animation and JavaScript to open up an modal window when a button is clicked. I also went back to yesterday's interface work and added some media queries. 

**Thoughts**: Having an off day today! Back to it tomorrow. I'm happy I managed to a do a little bit of coding at least!

**Link(s) to work**: Studying, some practice exercises and quizzes today.
