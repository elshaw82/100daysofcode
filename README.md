Documenting my 100 days of code


### Day 1: April 25, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: One of my favourite front-end resources is Frontend Mentor. They have a brilliant selection of designs to work from and today I started with Base Apparel. It really give me a chance to brush up on my Flexbox knowledge and put it into practice. 

The majority of my HTML/CSS knowledge comes from creating newsletters (what a breath of fresh air it was to use something like Flexbox as opposed to tables) and I really enjoy bringing designs to life with code. 

**Thoughts:** My JavaScript knowledge it pretty limited, I know some concepts like variables, methods, functions, but I haven't encountered any real world scenarios to put them into practice,  so for the form validation I coded along with a tutorial on YouTube as I find I learn better by 'doing'.

### Day 2: April 26, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I made some further updates to the Base Apparel landing page to make it responsive. 

**Thoughts**: It's been really satisfying to get to grips with elements I'm less familiar with (coming from an email template background) such as position and flexbox. While I can see how the JavaScript is working it's magic, I still couldn't write that particular script from scratch - I need to keep in mind that it's a brand new language and to stick with it.

### Day 3: April 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've been doing a lot of CSS quiz's on the fly to test my knowledge. I think overall it's really good, but I defintely know where the gaps in my knowledge lie.

**Thoughts** I need to research more JavaScipt resources with practical exercises. 

### Day 4: April 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I started a new landing page from Frontend Mentor. It's another 2 column example but I really wanted to use Flexbox again and try some multi-input validation JS. 

**Thoughts** I haven't added any JS yet. I figured I would try the Wes Bos JavaScript30 challenge and then revisit. But the landing page looks good on desktop and mobile.

### Day 5: April 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I started the Wes Bos JavaScript30 challenge, which I loved. He really breaks it all down to make it less daunting. I even managed to code ahead for a bit of it and didn't break anything! Obviously I redesigned it all because I love CSS. I used Grid for the first time!

**Thoughts** It feels really good to stick with these projects and finish them. Too often I've been guilty of jumping from tutorial to tutorial and getting zero out of it apart from confusing myself! Excited for the next project.

### Day 6: April 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today's project was a JavaScript clock. Again, I coded along and then added my own CSS. I could feel myself getting carried away and wanting to transform the background into a 70's wall, complete with 3 flying ornamental ducks, jazzy wallpaper and a crazy clockface. But alas, I held back and kept it relatively clean and simple! The tutorials are definitely starting to make an impact. I'm anticipating the next lines of code and (mostly) getting it right!

I also discovered the debugging term 'Rubber Ducking' which is a fun bit of trivia I will definitely be putting into practice in the near future.

**Thoughts** I find when I'm really in this zone of learning and enjoying creating, I have to fight the urge to start multiple new projects. It mostly happens when I see amazing work by other developers. For example I saw on Twitter today someone had created a Macbook keyboard using CSS...immediately wanted to create my own. FOCUS!! My main goal for this challenge is to learn JavaScript. Plenty of time for CSS later.
