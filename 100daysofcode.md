Documenting my 100 days of code


### Day 1: April 26, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: One of my favourite front-end resources is Frontend Mentor. They have a brilliant selection of designs to work from and today I started with Base Apparel. It really give me a chance to rush up on my Flexbox knowledge and put it into practice. 

The majority of my HTML/CSS knowledge comes from creating newsletters (what a breath of fresh air it was to use something like Flexbox as opposed to tables.) and I really enjoy bringing designs to life with code. 

**Thoughts:** My JavaScript knowledge it pretty limited, I know some concepts like variables, methods, function but I haven't encountered any real world scenarios to put them into practice,  so for the form validation I coded along with a tutorial on YouTube as I find I learn better by 'doing'.

### Day 2: April 26, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I made some further updates to the Base Apparel landing page to make it responsive. 

**Thoughts**: It's been really satisfying to get to grips with elements I'm less familiar with (coming from a email template background) such as position and flexbox. While I can see how the JavaScript is working it's magic, I still couldn't write that particular script from scratch - I need to keep in mind that it's a brand new language and to stick with  it.

### Day 3: April 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've been doing a lot of CSS quiz's on the fly to test my knowledge. I think overall it's really good, but I defintely know where the gaps in my knowledge lie.

**Thoughts** I need to research more JavaScipt resources with practical exercises.
